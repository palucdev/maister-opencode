# Development Workflow: Resume

Resume an interrupted development workflow from where it left off.

## Usage

```bash
/maister:development-resume [task-path] [--from=PHASE] [--reset-attempts]
```

### Options

- `--from=PHASE`: Override resume point (`analysis`, `gap`, `spec`, `plan`, `implement`, `verify`)
- `--reset-attempts`: Reset auto-fix attempt counters (use if stuck in retry loop)

## Examples

```bash
# Resume most recent incomplete task
/maister:development-resume

# Resume specific task
/maister:development-resume .maister/tasks/development/2025-01-15-add-sorting/

# Resume from specific phase
/maister:development-resume --from=implement

# Reset retry counters
/maister:development-resume --reset-attempts
```
