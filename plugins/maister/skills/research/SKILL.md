# Research Orchestrator

Systematic research workflow from question definition to evidence-based documentation.

## Initialization

**BEFORE executing any phase, you MUST complete these steps:**

### Step 1: Load Framework Patterns

**Read the framework reference file NOW using the Read tool:**

1. `../orchestrator-framework/references/orchestrator-patterns.md` - Delegation rules, interactive mode, state schema, initialization, context passing, issue resolution

### Step 2: Initialize Workflow

1. **Create Task Items**: Use `TaskCreate` for all phases (see Phase Configuration), then set dependencies with `TaskUpdate addBlockedBy`
2. **Create Task Directory**: `.maister/tasks/research/YYYY-MM-DD-task-name/`
3. **Initialize State**: Create `orchestrator-state.yml` with research context

**Output**:
```
🚀 Research Orchestrator Started

Task: [research question]
Directory: [task-path]

Starting Phase 1: Initialize research...
```

---

## When to Use

Use when:
- Need comprehensive research on a topic
- Exploring codebase patterns or architecture
- Gathering requirements or best practices
- Want systematic evidence-based answers
- Research will feed into development workflows

**DO NOT use for**: Development tasks, bug fixes, performance optimization.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Evidence-Based**: Every finding must have source citation
2. **Systematic**: Follow structured methodology for consistent results
3. **Multi-Source**: Gather from codebase, docs, config, external sources
4. **Synthesized**: Cross-reference findings, identify patterns
5. **Actionable**: Produce outputs that enable next steps

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Research Foundation

**Purpose**: Initialize research, plan methodology, gather information from all sources, and synthesize findings into a research report
**Execute**: Multi-step: Direct + research-planner + information-gatherer (xN) + research-synthesizer
**Output**: `planning/research-brief.md`, `planning/research-plan.md`, `planning/sources.md`, `analysis/findings/*.md`, `analysis/synthesis.md`, `outputs/research-report.md`
**State**: Set `research_context.research_type`, `research_question`, `scope`, `methodology`, `sources`, `confidence_level`, `gathering_strategy`

This phase executes 4 sequential steps. On resume, check existing artifacts to skip completed steps.

#### Step 1: Initialize (Direct)

**Artifacts**: `planning/research-brief.md`
**Resume check**: If `planning/research-brief.md` exists, skip to Step 2

1. Parse research question (from command or prompt user)
2. Classify research type (auto-detect from keywords or use `--type` flag)
3. Determine scope (included, excluded, constraints)
4. Define success criteria
5. Create research brief
6. Update state: set `research_context.research_type`, `research_question`, `scope`

#### Step 2: Plan (Subagent)

**Artifacts**: `planning/research-plan.md`, `planning/sources.md`
**Resume check**: If `planning/research-plan.md` AND `planning/sources.md` exist, skip to Step 3

**Read `references/research-methodologies.md` NOW using the Read tool** — research type classification, methodology selection, gathering strategies

**INVOKE NOW**: Use Task tool with `subagent_type: maister:research-planner`

**Context to pass**: task_path, research_brief_path, research_type, research_question, scope

Update state: `research_context.methodology`, `sources`

#### Step 3: Gather + Merge (Parallel Subagents + Direct)

**Artifacts**: `analysis/findings/*.md` (category-specific)
**Resume check**: If any `analysis/findings/*.md` files exist, skip to Step 4

**Determine gatherer count and categories**:
1. Read `planning/research-plan.md` for **Gathering Strategy** section
2. If gathering strategy found: use specified categories and count (cap at 8 max)
3. If no gathering strategy: fall back to default 4 categories (codebase, documentation, configuration, external)
4. Update state: `research_context.gathering_strategy`

**CRITICAL: Launch all N agents in ONE message for parallel execution.**

**Parallel Execution Pattern**:
```
Read gathering strategy from research-plan.md
For each category in strategy:
  Use Task tool: source_category=[category_id] → analysis/findings/[prefix]-*.md
```

#### Step 4: Synthesize (Subagent)

**Artifacts**: `analysis/synthesis.md`, `outputs/research-report.md`
**Resume check**: If `analysis/synthesis.md` AND `outputs/research-report.md` exist, skip (Phase 1 complete)

**INVOKE NOW**: Use Task tool with `subagent_type: maister:research-synthesizer`

**Context to pass**: task_path, findings_directory_path, research_question, research_type, methodology

**Synthesizer produces**:
- Pattern analysis and cross-references (`analysis/synthesis.md`)
- Comprehensive research report answering research question (`outputs/research-report.md`)
- Confidence levels for each finding
- Documented gaps and uncertainties

Update state: `research_context.confidence_level`

---

→ Pause

AskUserQuestion - "Research foundation complete (initialized, planned, gathered, synthesized). Continue to brainstorming evaluation?"

---

### Phase 2: Optional Phases Decision

**Purpose**: Evaluate whether brainstorming and/or design phases would be valuable (independently)
**Execute**: Direct
**Output**: Updated `orchestrator-state.yml`
**State**: Set `options.brainstorming_enabled`, `options.design_enabled`

**Auto-resolve if**: `--brainstorm`/`--no-brainstorm` flags (brainstorming only), `--design`/`--no-design` flags (design only)

**Process**:
1. Read `analysis/synthesis.md` summary and `research_type` from state
2. Evaluate brainstorming value based on:
   - Number of viable approaches identified in synthesis (multiple → valuable)
   - Problem novelty (new domain → valuable; well-understood → less so)
   - Whether synthesis identified competing trade-offs (yes → valuable)
3. Evaluate design value based on:
   - Whether research suggests architectural decisions (yes → valuable)
   - Research type (requirements/mixed → likely valuable; technical → depends)
   - Whether design artifacts would feed into development workflow
4. If `brainstorming_enabled` not already set by flag, AskUserQuestion:
   - "[Brainstorming recommendation]. Would you like to explore solution alternatives?"
   - Options: "Yes, explore alternatives" / "No, skip brainstorming"
5. If `design_enabled` not already set by flag, AskUserQuestion:
   - "[Design recommendation]. Would you like to generate a high-level design?"
   - Options: "Yes, generate design" / "No, skip design"
6. Update state: set `brainstorming_enabled` and `design_enabled`

→ If brainstorming enabled: continue to Phase 3
→ If brainstorming disabled AND design enabled: skip to Phase 4
→ If both disabled: skip to Phase 5

---

### Phase 3: Solution Brainstorming

**Purpose**: Explore solution alternatives from research evidence, then let user converge on chosen approaches
**Execute**: Orchestrator-Direct Hybrid
**Output**: `outputs/solution-exploration.md`
**State**: Update `phase_summaries.phase-2`

**Skip if**: `brainstorming_enabled = false` (user chose to skip in Phase 2, or `--no-brainstorm` flag)

**Read `references/brainstorming-techniques.md` NOW using the Read tool** — divergent/convergent thinking techniques, scope guardrails

**Part A — Solution Generation (Subagent)**:

Generate alternatives purely from research evidence, without user preference bias.

> **ANTI-PATTERN**: Do NOT generate solution alternatives inline. The solution-brainstormer agent has specialized multi-perspective analysis capabilities.

**INVOKE NOW**: Use Task tool with `subagent_type: maister:solution-brainstormer`

**Context to pass** (Pattern 7):
- `task_path`, `synthesis_path`, `research_report_path`
- Accumulated context: `research_type`, `research_question`, `confidence_level`, `phase_summaries` (Phase 1)

> **SELF-CHECK**: After Task tool returns, verify `outputs/solution-exploration.md` exists and contains alternatives. If missing, this is a CRITICAL failure.

**Part B — Present & Converge (Direct)**:

> **ANTI-PATTERN**: Do NOT present all decision areas in a single summary table and ask one combined "do you agree?" question. Each area MUST get its own detailed presentation and its own AskUserQuestion call.
>
> **ANTI-PATTERN**: Do NOT show full alternatives/pros/cons for the first area and then shortcut remaining areas to just a recommendation line + question. EVERY area gets the SAME level of detail — all alternatives with descriptions, pros, and cons. No exceptions.

1. Read `outputs/solution-exploration.md`
2. For each decision area sequentially, output ALL of the following (steps a-d) BEFORE calling AskUserQuestion:
   a. **Area header**: area name and why this decision matters (1-2 sentences of context)
   b. **Alternatives detail**: For EVERY alternative in this area, show:
      - Name and description (2-3 sentences)
      - Pros (bullet list)
      - Cons (bullet list)
   c. **Recommendation**: which alternative is recommended and why (1 sentence)
   d. **AskUserQuestion**: this area's alternatives as options (mark recommended with "(Recommended)") + "Need more info" option
   e. If user picks → record choice, move to next area
   f. If "Need more info" → present the detailed trade-off analysis for the requested alternative, then re-ask

> **SELF-CHECK before each AskUserQuestion**: Did you output the alternatives with pros/cons for THIS area? If you only showed a recommendation line without listing all alternatives and their pros/cons, STOP and output the full detail before asking.

3. After all areas resolved, present a brief summary of the chosen combination
4. Update state with chosen approaches per decision area

→ Pause

AskUserQuestion - "Brainstorming complete. Continue to high-level design?"

---

### Phase 4: High-Level Design

**Purpose**: Create architecture design from selected solution approach
**Execute**: Orchestrator-Direct Hybrid
**Output**: `outputs/high-level-design.md`, `outputs/decision-log.md`
**State**: Update `phase_summaries.phase-3`

**Skip if**: `design_enabled = false`

**Read `references/design-techniques.md` NOW using the Read tool** — MADR format, ADR guidance, decision documentation patterns

**Part A — Design Direction (Direct)**:
1. If Phase 3 ran: confirm selected approaches from brainstorming convergence
2. If Phase 3 was skipped: use research report recommendations as design input
3. AskUserQuestion for any design preferences or constraints (e.g., "Any architectural constraints or preferences?")

**Part B — Design Generation (Subagent)**:

> **ANTI-PATTERN**: Do NOT generate C4 architecture diagrams or ADRs inline. The solution-designer agent has specialized architecture and MADR documentation capabilities.

**INVOKE NOW**: Use Task tool with `subagent_type: maister:solution-designer`

**Context to pass** (Pattern 7):
- `task_path`, `synthesis_path`, `research_report_path`
- `solution_exploration_path` (only if Phase 3 ran)
- `selected_approach` (from Phase 3 convergence if ran, or from research report recommendations)
- `design_preferences` (from Part A)
- Accumulated context: `research_type`, `research_question`, `confidence_level`, `phase_summaries`

> **SELF-CHECK**: After Task tool returns, verify both `outputs/high-level-design.md` and `outputs/decision-log.md` exist. If missing, this is a CRITICAL failure.

**Part C — Summary (Direct)**:
3. Read `outputs/high-level-design.md` and `outputs/decision-log.md`
4. Present executive summary to user:
   - Architecture style and key components
   - Number of architectural decisions recorded
   - Key decision highlights (1 line each)
   - Integration points with existing system (if applicable)

→ Pause

AskUserQuestion - "Design complete. Continue to output generation?"

---

### Phase 5: Review Outputs

**Purpose**: Present research outputs summary to user and confirm completeness
**Execute**: Direct
**Output**: No new files — reviews existing outputs
**State**: Track output inventory

**Process**:
1. Inventory all generated outputs: `outputs/research-report.md` (always), plus conditional: `solution-exploration.md`, `high-level-design.md`, `decision-log.md`
2. Present summary of what was produced and key findings
3. Ask user if anything is missing or needs expansion

→ Pause

AskUserQuestion - "Research outputs ready. Continue to verification?"

---

### Phase 6: Verification (Optional)

**Purpose**: Verify research quality and completeness
**Execute**: Direct - present report, request user review
**Output**: `verification/verification-report.md`
**State**: Update verification status

**Skip if**: Technical research with high confidence, simple exploratory
**Enable if**: Mixed research, medium/low confidence, critical gaps identified

→ Conditional: if integration_enabled continue to Phase 7, else skip to Phase 8 check

---

### Phase 7: Integration (Optional)

**Purpose**: Integrate outputs into project documentation
**Execute**: Direct - save to appropriate locations
**Output**: `integration-manifest.md`
**State**: Track integration status

**Skip if**: Exploratory research not for documentation
**Enable if**: Design artifacts generated, research-report useful as reference

**Process**:
- For design artifacts: Save paths for parent orchestrator
- For research report: Ask user where to reference in `.maister/docs/`

→ Conditional: if design artifacts exist continue to Phase 8, else complete workflow

---

### Phase 8: Spawn Development (Optional)

**Purpose**: Offer to start development workflow with research context
**Execute**: Direct - AskUserQuestion for user decision
**Output**: Development workflow started (if chosen)
**State**: Track spawn decision

**Skip if**: No design artifacts generated

```
AskUserQuestion:
  Question: "Research produced design artifacts. Start development workflow?"
  Options:
  - "Start development with this research"
  - "Skip - I'll start manually later"
  - "Review outputs first"
```

If user chooses "Start development":
- Invoke Skill: `maister:development [current-research-task-path]`

→ End of workflow
