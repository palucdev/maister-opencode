name: ai-sdlc:init-sdlc
description: Initialize AI SDLC framework with intelligent project analysis and documentation generation
---

**NOTE**: This is a multi-step workflow that invokes other skills (docs-manager, project-analyzer) at specific phases. The `<command-name>` tag refers to THIS command only — you MUST still use the Skill tool and Task tool to invoke those other skills when instructed below.

## Initialization Process

Initialize `.ai-sdlc/docs/` with intelligent project analysis and meaningful documentation generation based on actual codebase inspection.

## PHASE 1: Pre-flight Checks

Check for existing structure:
```bash
# Check if .ai-sdlc/ already exists
if [ -d ".ai-sdlc" ]; then
    echo "⚠️  .ai-sdlc/ directory already exists"
    echo ""
    echo "Contents:"
    ls -la .ai-sdlc/
fi
```

**If .ai-sdlc/ exists**, use AskUserQuestion:
- Options: "Backup and reinitialize", "Update existing documentation", "Cancel"
- If "Backup": Create `.ai-sdlc.backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)/` using Bash tool
- If "Update": Skip to PHASE 5 (documentation population only)
- If "Cancel": Stop execution

**If proceeding**: Continue to PHASE 2

## PHASE 2: Project Analysis

**Run subagent project-analyzer**

**Wait for the subagent to complete before proceeding.**

Store the analysis results - you will use them in PHASE 5.


## PHASE 3: Present Findings & Gather Context

Present the analysis results to the user:

```markdown
# Project Analysis Complete

## Summary
- **Project Type**: [new/existing/legacy] (confidence: [high/medium/low])
- **Primary Language**: [language] ([version])
- **Primary Framework**: [framework] ([version])
- **Architecture**: [pattern]

## Tech Stack Detected
[Show detected technologies with confidence levels]

## Architecture
[Show discovered patterns and structure]

## Conventions
[Show naming and organization patterns]

## Current State
**Strengths**: [list]
**Opportunities**: [list]
```

**Use AskUserQuestion to confirm analysis**:
- Question: "Is this analysis accurate? Are there any missing technologies or incorrect classifications?"
- Options: "Yes, accurate", "No, let me provide corrections"

**If corrections needed**: Collect corrections from user.

**Gather additional context using AskUserQuestion**:

Ask the user (adapt questions based on project type):

1. **Project Name** (if not obvious): Use AskUserQuestion or prompt for input
2. **Project Description**: Brief 1-2 sentence description
3. **Primary Goals**:
   - New project: "What are you building? Who is it for?"
   - Existing project: "What are the main goals for the next 6-12 months?"
   - Legacy project: "What are your modernization priorities?"
4. **Team Context** (optional): Team size, development practices
5. **Special Requirements** (optional): Compliance, performance targets, constraints

Store all responses. Merge auto-detected information with user-provided context.

**NEW: Ask which project documentation to generate:**

Use AskUserQuestion with multi-select enabled:
- Question: "Which project documentation should we generate?"
- Options:
  - "Vision" - "Project vision, goals, and purpose" (selected by default)
  - "Roadmap" - "Development roadmap and planned features" (selected by default)
  - "Tech Stack" - "Technology choices and rationale" (ALWAYS selected, required)
  - "Architecture" - "System architecture and design patterns" (optional)
- Smart defaults based on projectArchitectureType from analysis:
  - **Standard/Frontend-only/Backend-only projects**: All selected by default
  - **Monorepo/Umbrella projects**: Only "Tech Stack" selected by default
- Store selected documentation types for Phase 5

---

## PHASE 3.5: Select Standards to Initialize

**NEW PHASE: Standards Selection with Smart Defaults**

Based on project analysis (projectArchitectureType and detected tech stack), present a standards checklist using AskUserQuestion.

**Smart Defaults Logic:**

Calculate smart defaults based on analysis:
```
smart_defaults = []

# Global standards - ALWAYS recommended
smart_defaults.append('global')

# Frontend standards - if frontend detected
if (frontend_framework_detected OR
    projectArchitectureType in ['frontend-only', 'mixed'] OR
    has_frontend_files):
    smart_defaults.append('frontend')

# Backend standards - if backend detected
if (backend_framework_detected OR
    projectArchitectureType in ['backend-only', 'mixed'] OR
    has_backend_files):
    smart_defaults.append('backend')

# Testing standards - ALWAYS recommended
smart_defaults.append('testing')
```

**Ask user to customize standards:**

First, show the smart defaults summary:
```markdown
## Standards Smart Defaults

Based on project analysis:
- **Project Type**: [projectArchitectureType]
- **Frontend Detected**: [Yes/No - frameworks]
- **Backend Detected**: [Yes/No - frameworks]

**Recommended Standards**:
- ✓ Global (error-handling, validation, conventions, coding-style, commenting)
- [✓/-] Frontend (css, components, accessibility, responsive)
- [✓/-] Backend (api, models, queries, migrations)
- ✓ Testing (test-writing)
```

Then use AskUserQuestion:
- Question: "Customize which technical standards to initialize? (Smart defaults pre-selected based on your project)"
- Multi-select: true
- Options:
  - "Global Standards" - "Error handling, validation, conventions, coding style, commenting" (always pre-selected)
  - "Frontend Standards" - "CSS, components, accessibility, responsive design" (pre-selected if frontend detected)
  - "Backend Standards" - "API design, models, database queries, migrations" (pre-selected if backend detected)
  - "Testing Standards" - "Test writing guidelines and best practices" (always pre-selected)
- Store selected standards as array for Phase 4

**Alternative: "Customize standards?" bypass:**

Alternatively, use a simpler two-step approach:
1. Show smart defaults summary
2. Ask: "Use smart defaults or customize standards selection?"
   - "Use smart defaults" → proceed with smart_defaults array
   - "Customize selection" → show multi-select question above

Choose the simpler approach to reduce friction.

---

## PHASE 4: Initialize Documentation Structure

**Invoke the docs-manager skill NOW using the Skill tool:**

```
command: docs-manager
```

Provide context: "Initialize documentation structure in this project with selected standards. Use analysis report from project-analyzer to inform structure.

**Standards Selection**: [Pass the standards_selection array from Phase 3.5]

Examples:
- ['global', 'frontend', 'backend', 'testing'] → Initialize all standards
- ['global', 'frontend', 'testing'] → Skip backend standards
- ['global', 'testing'] → Only global and testing standards

The docs-manager will only copy selected standard categories and create placeholder sections in INDEX.md for skipped categories."

The docs-manager skill will:
1. Create `.ai-sdlc/docs/` directory structure
2. Copy baseline standards from plugin (ONLY selected categories from Phase 3.5)
3. Create initial INDEX.md (with placeholders for skipped standards)
4. Create `.ai-sdlc/docs/project/initiatives/` directory for future initiatives
5. Update CLAUDE.md integration

**Wait for docs-manager to complete before proceeding.**

---

## PHASE 5: Create Project Documentation

Now create meaningful documentation using the analysis report and user input you gathered.

**IMPORTANT**: Only generate documentation that was selected in Phase 3. Check the selected_documentation array from Phase 3.

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Review Documentation
```bash
# Read the generated documentation
cat .ai-sdlc/docs/INDEX.md
cat .ai-sdlc/docs/project/vision.md
cat .ai-sdlc/docs/project/tech-stack.md
cat .ai-sdlc/docs/project/roadmap.md
```

### 2. Customize for Your Team
- Update vision.md with specific product goals
- Adjust roadmap priorities
- Customize standards in .ai-sdlc/docs/standards/
- Add team-specific conventions

### 3. Discover Existing Standards (Recommended)

**Auto-discover coding standards from your codebase:**

```bash
/ai-sdlc:standards:discover
```

This will analyze:
- ✓ Configuration files (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, etc.)
- ✓ Code patterns and naming conventions
- ✓ Documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING)
- ✓ Pull request review comments (if GitHub available)
- ✓ CI/CD requirements

**Time**: ~2-4 minutes | **Benefit**: Automatically document your team's existing practices

**Alternative**: Skip and manually add standards later using `/ai-sdlc:standards:update`

### 4. Start Development
```bash
# Start working on your first task
/work

# The /work command will:
# - Classify your task type (feature, bug-fix, enhancement, etc.)
# - Route to appropriate workflow orchestrator
# - Guide you through spec → plan → implement → verify

# Or update existing documentation
/docs-manager update project/vision
```

### 5. Keep Documentation Current
- Update roadmap as features complete
- Document architectural decisions
- Update tech-stack.md when technologies change
- Run docs-manager to keep INDEX.md updated

## 💡 Tips

✨ **AI is now documentation-aware**: Claude will automatically read `.ai-sdlc/docs/INDEX.md` before starting any task

✨ **Standards are active**: When implementing features, AI will follow standards from `.ai-sdlc/docs/standards/`

✨ **Documentation evolves**: Update docs as your project grows - documentation is a living artifact

✨ **Re-run anytime**: You can run `/init-sdlc` again to refresh documentation (it will backup existing docs)

## 📚 Documentation

For more information:
- Read `.ai-sdlc/docs/INDEX.md` for complete documentation map
- See CLAUDE.md for AI integration details
- Use `/docs-manager` skill for documentation management
