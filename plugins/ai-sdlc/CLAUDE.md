# AI SDLC Plugin

This plugin provides AI-powered Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) capabilities for Claude Code projects.

## Purpose

The AI SDLC plugin helps teams streamline software development workflows by providing:

- **Workflow Commands**: Slash commands for common SDLC tasks like feature development, bug fixes, and code reviews
- **Specialized Agents**: AI agents optimized for specific development tasks (spec writing, implementation, verification)
- **Skills**: Reusable capabilities for managing standards, documentation, and development workflows
- **Coding Standards**: Project-level standards and best practices that can be customized and enforced

## Installation

Install this plugin in your project to gain access to structured development workflows and standards management.

## Features

- Step-by-step guided development workflows
- Automated task planning and tracking
- Reusable skills for common development tasks
- Customizable coding standards
- Verification and quality assurance capabilities

## Critical Principle: User-Confirmed Rollback

**NEVER automatically rollback or revert code changes without user confirmation.**

All workflows in this plugin follow this pattern when failures occur:

1. **STOP** - Don't attempt automatic fixes for critical failures
2. **ANALYZE** - Examine the root cause (config issue? test setup? actual logic error?)
3. **CHECK FOR EASY FIXES** - Often failures are simple config/setup issues
4. **ASK USER** - Use `AskUserQuestion` with options:
   - "Try suggested fix" (if easy fix identified)
   - "Rollback changes" (user confirms rollback)
   - "Let me investigate" (pause for manual investigation)
5. **EXECUTE** - Only perform rollback if user explicitly confirms

**Rationale**: Automatic rollback discards potentially valid work, hides root causes, and frustrates users. Many failures are simple configuration issues with easy 1-line fixes.

## Task Types Supported

This plugin supports 9 comprehensive task types, each with adaptive workflows tailored to their specific needs:

| Task Type | Purpose | Workflow Stages | Classification Keywords |
|-----------|---------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Initiative** | Epic-level multi-task coordination | 6 stages | "epic", "project", "initiative", "feature set", "multiple tasks" |
| **New Feature** | Add completely new capability | 6-7 stages | "add", "new feature", "create", "build" |
| **Bug Fix** | Fix defects and errors | 4 stages | "fix", "bug", "broken", "error", "crash" |
| **Enhancement** | Improve existing features | 6 stages | "improve", "enhance", "better", "upgrade existing" |
| **Refactoring** | Improve code structure | 5 stages | "refactor", "clean up", "restructure" |
| **Performance** | Optimize speed/efficiency | 5 stages | "slow", "optimize", "speed up", "faster" |
| **Security** | Fix vulnerabilities | 4-5 stages | "vulnerability", "security", "exploit", "CVE" |
| **Migration** | Move tech/patterns | 6 stages | "migrate", "move from X to Y", "upgrade" |
| **Documentation** | Create user docs | 4 stages | "document", "docs", "write guide", "FAQ" |

### Design Principles

- **Adaptive Workflows**: Different task types have different natural progressions (4-7 stages)
- **Flexible Granularity**: Complex steps can have substeps when needed
- **Consistent Core**: All types share planning, specification, implementation, and verification phases
- **Conditional Stages**: Some stages activate based on task characteristics (e.g., security review for auth features)

## Terminology

To avoid confusion, this plugin uses specific terminology:

**Development Task** (or simply "Task")
- The high-level work item: a bug fix, new feature, enhancement, refactoring, etc.
- Represents the overall piece of work from start to finish
- Located in: `.ai-sdlc/tasks/[type]/YYYY-MM-DD-task-name/`
- Contains: specification, requirements, implementation plan, and verification results

**Implementation Step** (or "Implementation Task")
- Specific actionable steps executed during the implementation phase
- The detailed breakdown of HOW to build the development task
- Listed in: `implementation-plan.md` within each development task folder
- Example: "1.1 Create User model", "2.3 Write API endpoint", "3.5 Add form validation"

**Key Distinction**: A "development task" is WHAT to build (the feature/fix), while "implementation steps" are HOW to build it (the specific actions).

## User-Centric Development Focus

This plugin prioritizes usability and user experience throughout development:

### User Journey Analysis

**During Requirements Gathering** (New Features):
- Asks how users will discover the feature
- Identifies target personas (admin, regular user, power user, etc.)
- Maps feature into existing workflows
- Documents access patterns and navigation paths

**During Gap Analysis** (Enhancements):
Comprehensive analysis ensuring complete, usable features:

**User Journey Impact Assessment**:
- **Feature Reachability**: Current vs new access paths, dead end analysis, discoverability scoring (1-10 scale)
- **Multi-Persona Analysis**: Per-persona workflow impact assessment with value/learning curve metrics
- **Flow Integration**: How enhancement fits existing workflows without disruption
- **Navigation Consistency**: Alignment with app-wide UI/navigation patterns
- **Discoverability Before/After**: Quantified improvement metrics showing usability impact

**Data Entity Lifecycle Analysis**:
- **Three-Layer Verification Framework**: Backend capability + UI component + User accessibility (all required)
- **Backend ≠ User Operability**: API endpoints alone don't confirm users can actually perform operations
- **Orphaned Display Detection**: Flags features that display data with no way to input it (useless feature)
- **Orphaned Input Detection**: Flags data capture with nowhere to view/use it (user frustration)
- **Layer 3 Critical Checks**: Component rendering, page routing, navigation access, permissions
- **Multi-Touchpoint Discovery**: Finds ALL places where data should appear, not just user-mentioned locations
- **CRUD Completeness**: Ensures data has complete lifecycle with verified user accessibility
- **Scope Expansion Recommendations**: Suggests phased approach when critical gaps found
- **Safety-Critical Awareness**: Heightened analysis for healthcare, finance, legal domains

**Why This Matters**:
- Prevents orphaned features that users can't find
- Ensures logical user flows and navigation
- Identifies discoverability issues early
- Analyzes impact from multiple persona perspectives
- Documents navigation integration concerns
- **Prevents incomplete features**: Catches "display allergy info" requests that lack input mechanisms
- **Ensures safety**: Identifies missing critical touchpoints (e.g., allergies in prescription workflow)

**Real-World Example**:
User requests: "Display allergy info on patient summary"

*Without data lifecycle analysis*:
- ✅ Implements display component
- ❌ No way to input allergies (feature useless)
- ❌ Missing from prescription workflow (safety issue)

*With data lifecycle analysis*:
- ⚠️ Detects orphaned display (no input mechanism)
- ⚠️ Discovers 5 additional critical touchpoints (prescriptions, appointments, emergencies)
- ✅ Recommends phased approach: Phase 1 (input + 3 critical displays), Phase 2 (remaining displays), Phase 3 (edit/delete)
- ✅ Result: Complete, safe, usable feature

**Output**: Ensures features are discoverable, accessible, complete, and logically integrated into the application

### ASCII Mockup Generation

For UI-heavy features/enhancements, the plugin can generate ASCII mockups:
- Shows how new UI integrates with existing layout structure
- Identifies reusable components from current codebase
- Visualizes navigation patterns and placement
- Annotates with actual component file references
- Ensures consistency with existing app patterns

**When Used**:
- Optional phase in feature/enhancement workflows
- Auto-triggered for UI-heavy work (based on keyword detection)
- Invoked automatically by development-orchestrator (for enhancements and features)

**Output**: `analysis/ui-mockups.md` with ASCII diagrams

**Example**:
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Toolbar: [Existing] [Buttons] [NEW] │
│          └─ Integration point here   │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Benefits**:
- Visualize layout before implementation
- Ensure consistency with existing UI
- Identify reusable components early
- Prevent navigation confusion
- No external design tools needed

## Structure Organization

### Separation of Concerns

This plugin separates reference documentation from work items:

**`.ai-sdlc/docs/`** - Reference documentation (stable)
- Project vision, roadmap, tech stack
- Coding standards and conventions
- Architecture documentation
- Read these to understand the project

**`.ai-sdlc/tasks/`** - Work items (active, growing)
- Individual development tasks
- Feature implementations, bug fixes, etc.
- Active work in progress
- Create/reference these when building

**Why separate?**
- Keeps INDEX.md focused on project understanding (not task lists)
- Better scalability (tasks grow independently from docs)
- Clearer navigation (docs = learn, tasks = work)
- Different lifecycle (docs = stable reference, tasks = active work)

## Documentation & Task Organization

### Project Documentation Structure

The ai-sdlc plugin uses this structure:

```
.ai-sdlc/
├── docs/                         # Reference documentation (stable)
│   ├── INDEX.md                 # Master index - READ THIS FIRST
│   ├── project/                 # Project-level documentation
│   │   ├── vision.md           # Project vision and goals
│   │   ├── roadmap.md          # Development roadmap
│   │   ├── tech-stack.md       # Technology choices and rationale
│   │   └── architecture.md     # System architecture (optional)
│   └── standards/               # Technical standards and conventions
│       ├── global/             # Language-agnostic standards
│       ├── frontend/           # Frontend-specific standards
│       ├── backend/            # Backend-specific standards
│       └── testing/            # Testing standards
└── tasks/                        # Development tasks (active, growing)
    ├── new-features/
    ├── bug-fixes/
    ├── enhancements/
    ├── refactoring/
    ├── performance/
    ├── security/
    ├── migrations/
    └── documentation/
```

**Core Principle**:
- Reference documentation in `.ai-sdlc/docs/` is the source of truth for understanding the project
- Always read `docs/INDEX.md` first to understand available documentation and standards
- Development tasks live separately in `.ai-sdlc/tasks/` for better organization and scalability

### Development Task Organization

Development tasks are organized by type in `.ai-sdlc/tasks/` using type-based folders:

```
.ai-sdlc/tasks/
├── new-features/
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD-task-name/
├── bug-fixes/
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD-task-name/
├── enhancements/
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD-task-name/
├── refactoring/
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD-task-name/
├── performance/
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD-task-name/
├── security/
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD-task-name/
├── migrations/
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD-task-name/
└── documentation/
    └── YYYY-MM-DD-task-name/
```

**Benefits of type-based organization:**
- Instant filtering by task type
- Clear categorization in IDE
- Easy analytics (count tasks by type)
- Better team organization
- Scales well to 100s of tasks

### Base Task Structure

Each development task follows a common structure with core directories:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-task-name/
├── metadata.yml                  # Task metadata and tracking
├── analysis/                     # Analysis and planning artifacts
│   ├── requirements.md          # Gathered requirements
│   └── visuals/                 # Design mockups and wireframes
├── implementation/               # Implementation work
│   ├── spec.md                  # Main specification (WHAT to build)
│   ├── implementation-plan.md   # Implementation steps breakdown (HOW to build)
│   └── work-log.md              # Chronological activity log
├── verification/                 # Verification results
│   └── spec-verification.md    # Specification verification report
└── documentation/                # User-facing docs (if applicable)
```

Task types can add specialized subdirectories as needed (e.g., `analysis/bug-analysis/` for bug fixes, `implementation/metrics/` for performance tasks).

**Note**: The `implementation/implementation-plan.md` file contains implementation steps (the detailed breakdown of actions), created by the implementation-planner skill after the specification is approved.

### Naming Conventions

**Task Type Directories:**
- Use plural form: `bug-fixes/`, not `bug-fix/`
- Use kebab-case: `new-features/`, not `new_features/`
- Use full words: `performance/`, not `perf/`

**Task Directories:**
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-task-name`
- Example: `2025-10-23-user-authentication`
- Example: `2025-10-23-fix-login-timeout`
- Date prefix enables chronological sorting
- Concise but descriptive name (3-5 words)
- No task type in name (it's in parent directory)

### Integration

- **Documentation Discovery**: Always read `.ai-sdlc/docs/INDEX.md` before starting work to understand project context
- **Task Discovery**: Browse `.ai-sdlc/tasks/[type]/` to find development tasks by type
- **Standards Compliance**: Follow standards from `.ai-sdlc/docs/standards/` during implementation
- **Task Tracking**: Use `metadata.yml` in each task folder for status, priority, tags, and time tracking
- **Activity Logging**: Record work in `implementation/work-log.md` for transparency

## Plugin Documentation Principles

These principles guide how we document skills, commands, orchestrators, and agents in this plugin to avoid verbosity and duplication while trusting Claude to reason effectively.

### Philosophy

**Trust Claude to reason.** Provide principles and patterns, not prescriptive implementations. Claude can discover technical details from skill.md files when needed—CLAUDE.md and commands should guide thinking, not dictate exact steps.

### Core Principles

1. **No Verbose Pseudocode** - Show conceptual patterns and decision frameworks, not complete implementations
2. **No Prescriptive Templates** - Guide thinking with principles, don't dictate exact prompts or scripts
3. **Avoid Duplication** - If technical details exist in skill.md, reference them in CLAUDE.md/commands
4. **Commands as Thin Wrappers** - User-facing guidance in commands, technical orchestration logic in skills
5. **Single Source of Truth** - Orchestration logic lives in skill.md, not scattered across multiple files
6. **Principle Over Process** - Explain WHY and WHEN, trust Claude to figure out HOW

### Content Guidelines

Target lengths for different documentation types:

| Documentation Type | Target Length | Focus |
|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| Skill descriptions (in CLAUDE.md) | 5-15 lines | Purpose, key capabilities, philosophy |
| Command descriptions (in CLAUDE.md) | 3-8 lines | What it does, when to use |
| Orchestrator sections (in CLAUDE.md) | 20-30 lines | Overview, key features, reference skill |
| Reference files (in skills/) | <1,000 lines | Conceptual patterns, not implementations |
| Agent files (in agents/) | 300-450 lines | Core mission, decision frameworks, workflow principles |

### When Adding New Content

Ask these questions before documenting:

1. **"Does this duplicate skill.md content?"** → Reference instead of duplicating
2. **"Am I providing exact implementation?"** → Simplify to principles
3. **"Would Claude need this spelled out?"** → Probably not, trust reasoning ability
4. **"Is this a manual or guidance?"** → Should be guidance, not manual

### Examples

**❌ Too Verbose** (Manual approach):
```markdown
**Process**:
1. Initialize: Check prerequisites, load state, validate inputs
2. Analyze: Parse task description, extract key entities, determine scope
3. Plan: Create task groups, define dependencies, set milestones
4. Execute: For each group: (a) run tests, (b) implement, (c) verify
5. Finalize: Generate report, update metadata, commit changes
```

**✅ Principle-Based** (Guidance approach):
```markdown
Orchestrates implementation from plan to verified code. Adapts execution complexity based on task size, maintains continuous standards discovery, follows test-driven approach.

**See**: `skills/implementer/skill.md` for execution modes and technical details.
```

## Reference Documentation Guidelines

Reference files (`references/*.md`) in skills provide conceptual patterns and decision frameworks. They guide implementation rather than provide complete code.

### Purpose of References

References should answer:
- **WHAT** patterns to use (strategies, approaches)
- **WHEN** to apply them (decision criteria)
- **WHY** certain approaches work (rationale)
- **HOW** (conceptually) to structure solutions (high-level)

References should NOT contain:
- Complete function implementations
- Production-ready code (>10 lines)
- Extensive pseudocode implementations
- Framework-specific boilerplate

### Size Guidelines

| Reference Type | Target Size | Max Size | Token Budget |
|---------------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Orchestrator phase reference | 600-800 lines | 1,000 lines | ~8K tokens |
| Algorithm pattern reference | 400-600 lines | 800 lines | ~6K tokens |
| Strategy/decision reference | 300-500 lines | 600 lines | ~4K tokens |

**Total per skill**: Aim for <3,000 lines across all references (~24K tokens)

### Content Structure

**✅ Good Reference Style** (Conceptual):
```markdown
### Algorithm: Feature Detection

**Purpose**: Locate existing files using multi-strategy search

**Strategy**:
1. **Filename search**: Extract nouns → Generate patterns → Glob search
2. **Code pattern search**: Detect tech hints → Search for patterns → Grep
3. **Scoring**: Combine filename match + directory + size + tests + usage

**Decision Criteria**:
- High confidence (>80%): Present top 3 matches
- Medium confidence (50-80%): Present top 5 with warnings
- Low confidence (<50%): Expand search or prompt user

**Output**: Ranked list with confidence scores
```

**❌ Bad Reference Style** (Implementation):
```python
def detect_feature_files(description, codebase_root):
    """Complete 100-line implementation"""
    tokens = tokenize(description)
    patterns = []
    for token in tokens:
        # 50+ lines of detailed logic
        patterns.append(generate_pattern(token))
    # More implementation details...
    return scored_results
```

### When to Use Code Examples

Acceptable scenarios for code examples (keep <10 lines):
- **Test patterns**: Show expected test structure
- **Configuration examples**: YAML/JSON structure samples
- **API usage**: Brief integration examples
- **Decision pseudocode**: If-then logic (5-10 lines max)

### Review Checklist

Before finalizing reference documentation:

✓ Does this explain WHAT/WHEN/WHY rather than implement HOW?
✓ Are code examples <10 lines and conceptual?
✓ Is total file size under target guidelines?
✓ Could an experienced developer implement from this guide?
✓ Is it tool/framework agnostic where possible?
✓ Does it focus on patterns over implementation?

### Philosophy

**References are maps, not detailed instructions.**
- Maps show landmarks, routes, decision points
- Instructions show every step, every turn
- Skills/agents follow the map to create their own path

## Orchestrator Creation Guidelines

When creating new workflow orchestrators, ensure ALL of these elements are included. This checklist prevents incomplete orchestrators.

### Required Structural Elements

1. **State File Creation**
   - MUST create `orchestrator-state.yml` in initialization (explicit STEP)
   - Include: task_type, mode, current_phase, completed_phases, failed_phases, auto_fix_attempts, options
   - State file is source of truth for resume logic

2. **Phase Execution Loop**
   Every phase MUST follow this 7-step pattern:
   - STEP 1: Check if phase already completed (read state)
   - STEP 2: Update state to current phase
   - STEP 3: Pre-phase announcement
   - STEP 4: Execute phase
   - STEP 5: Handle errors (with retry limits)
   - STEP 6: Update state on success
   - STEP 7: Post-phase review (interactive mode only)

3. **Explicit Tool Invocations**
   - **AskUserQuestion**: Every user decision point must have explicit tool call pattern
   - **Task tool**: Every subagent invocation must have explicit Task tool parameters
   - **Skill invocations**: Clearly state which skill to invoke and with what parameters

### Required Interactive Mode Features

4. **Post-Phase Review Pattern**
   In interactive mode, after each phase MUST use AskUserQuestion:
   ```
   Use AskUserQuestion tool:
     Question: "Phase [N] complete. How would you like to proceed?"
     Header: "Phase Complete"
     Options:
     1. "Continue to next phase" - Proceed with workflow
     2. "Review outputs in detail" - Open phase artifacts
     3. "Restart this phase" - Re-execute this phase
     4. "Stop workflow" - Pause and resume later
   ```

5. **User Decision Points**
   Any place requiring user input MUST use AskUserQuestion:
   - Optional phase enablement (E2E, user docs, code review)
   - Scope decisions (expand scope, critical only, minimal)
   - Error recovery (retry, skip, rollback, stop)
   - Verification check selection

6. **Inline STOP Reminders in Phase Definitions**
   **CRITICAL**: Each phase definition MUST end with an inline STOP reminder:
   ```markdown
   **⏸️ INTERACTIVE MODE: STOP HERE** - After this phase completes, you MUST use AskUserQuestion before proceeding to Phase [N+1].
   ```

   **Why this is critical**:
   - Orchestration logic at the end of files often gets missed
   - Claude reads phase definitions first and executes immediately
   - Inline reminders ensure the STOP instruction is seen when executing each phase
   - Without inline reminders, Claude runs through all phases continuously

### Required Standards Integration

7. **Standards Discovery**
   Reference `.ai-sdlc/docs/INDEX.md` in these phases:
   - Phase 5 (Spec): Read INDEX.md before creating spec
   - Phase 7 (Plan): Ensure plan follows project conventions
   - Phase 8 (Implement): Continuous standards discovery
   - Phase 11 (Verify): Verify against documented standards

   Include reminder before these phases:
   ```
   📋 Standards Discovery
   Reading .ai-sdlc/docs/INDEX.md to check applicable standards...
   ```

### Required Verification Elements

8. **Comprehensive Verification**
   Verification phase must include:
   - Plan completion check
   - Full test suite execution
   - Standards compliance verification
   - Task-type-specific checks
   - **Reality check**: Invoke `reality-assessor` subagent via Task tool
   - **Pragmatic review**: Invoke `code-quality-pragmatist` subagent via Task tool

### Orchestrator Completeness Checklist

Before considering an orchestrator complete, verify ALL items:

| Element | Required | Verification |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| State file creation in initialization | ✓ | Does STEP 3 explicitly CREATE orchestrator-state.yml? |
| Phase Execution Loop pattern | ✓ | Are all 7 STEPs documented? |
| Post-phase review with AskUserQuestion | ✓ | Is STEP 7 implemented with explicit tool call? |
| **Inline STOP reminders** | ✓ | Does EACH phase end with "⏸️ INTERACTIVE MODE: STOP HERE"? |
| Explicit AskUserQuestion for all decisions | ✓ | Do ALL user prompts have tool call examples? |
| Explicit Task tool for subagents | ✓ | Do ALL subagent invocations show Task parameters? |
| Standards discovery in Phases 5,7,8,11 | ✓ | Is INDEX.md referenced in each? |
| Reality check (Phase 11) | ✓ | Is reality-assessor invoked via implementation-verifier? |
| Pragmatic review (Phase 11) | ✓ | Is code-quality-pragmatist invoked via implementation-verifier? |
| TodoWrite initialization | ✓ | Are todos created at workflow start? |
| Error handling with retry limits | ✓ | Does each phase have max attempts? |

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Structure without orchestration**: Defining phases without Phase Execution Loop
❌ **Implicit user prompts**: Describing prompts without explicit AskUserQuestion tool calls
❌ **Missing inline STOP reminders**: Phase definitions without "⏸️ INTERACTIVE MODE: STOP HERE" at the end
❌ **Orchestration logic at file end only**: Relying on instructions at the end of the file (often missed during execution)
❌ **Vague subagent calls**: Saying "invoke X" without Task tool parameters
❌ **Missing standards**: Not referencing INDEX.md in relevant phases
❌ **Incomplete verification**: Running tests without reality check and pragmatic review
❌ **No state management**: Not creating/updating orchestrator-state.yml

## Key Workflow Principles

1. **Documentation First**: Always check docs/INDEX.md before and during work
2. **Specification Before Implementation**: Create clear specs before coding
3. **Planning Before Execution**: Break implementation into manageable steps
4. **Test-Driven Approach**: Write tests first, implement, then verify
5. **Continuous Standards Discovery**: Check standards throughout, not just at start
6. **Incremental Verification**: Run only new tests after each group, not entire suite
7. **Comprehensive Verification Before Commit**: Run full test suite and create verification report before code review

**For detailed workflow documentation, see**: `docs/guides/workflow-overview.md`

## Progress Tracking with TodoWrite

All orchestrators use `TodoWrite` for real-time progress visibility:
- At workflow start: Create todos for all phases (pending)
- At each phase: Mark `in_progress` → execute → mark `completed`
- State file (`orchestrator-state.yml`) is source of truth for resume logic
- TodoWrite mirrors state for UX, doesn't control workflow

See individual orchestrator `skill.md` files for phase-specific todo tables.
