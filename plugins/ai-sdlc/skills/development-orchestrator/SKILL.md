# Development Orchestrator

Unified workflow for bug fixes, enhancements, and new features with task-type-specific adaptations.

## MANDATORY Initialization (Before Any Phase Work)

**CRITICAL: You MUST complete these steps BEFORE executing any workflow phase:**

### Step 0: Load Framework Patterns

**STOP. You MUST read these files NOW using the Read tool before continuing:**

1. `../orchestrator-framework/references/phase-execution-pattern.md` - 7-step phase loop
2. `../orchestrator-framework/references/delegation-enforcement.md` - Delegation patterns and subagent result handling
3. `../orchestrator-framework/references/interactive-mode.md` - Phase gates and AUTO-CONTINUE
4. `../orchestrator-framework/references/state-management.md` - State file operations

**⚠️ FAILURE TO READ THESE FILES IS A WORKFLOW VIOLATION.**

These patterns define:
- How to execute each phase (7-step loop)
- How to delegate to skills (mandatory patterns)
- When to auto-continue vs pause (Phase Gates and ⚡ AUTO)
- How to consume subagent results and continue workflow
- How to manage orchestrator-state.yml

**SELF-CHECK:**
- [ ] Did you use the Read tool to read all 4 files?
- [ ] Do you understand the AUTO-CONTINUE pattern in interactive-mode.md?
- [ ] Do you understand Pattern 6 (Consuming Subagent Results) in delegation-enforcement.md?

If NO to any: STOP and read the files now.

### Step 1: Create TodoWrite with All Phases

**Immediately use the TodoWrite tool** to create todos for all phases:

```
Use TodoWrite tool with todos:
[
  {"content": "Check dependencies", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Checking dependencies"},
  {"content": "Analyze codebase", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Analyzing codebase"},
  {"content": "Clarify requirements", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Clarifying requirements"},
  {"content": "Analyze gaps", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Analyzing gaps"},
  {"content": "Write failing test (TDD Red)", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Writing failing test"},
  {"content": "Clarify scope & approach", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Clarifying scope & approach"},
  {"content": "Generate UI mockups", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Generating UI mockups"},
  {"content": "Clarify technical approach", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Clarifying technical approach"},
  {"content": "Create specification", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Creating specification"},
  {"content": "Decide architecture", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Deciding architecture"},
  {"content": "Audit specification", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Auditing specification"},
  {"content": "Plan implementation", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Planning implementation"},
  {"content": "Execute implementation", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Executing implementation"},
  {"content": "Verify test passes (TDD Green)", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Verifying test passes"},
  {"content": "Prompt verification options", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Prompting verification options"},
  {"content": "Verify implementation", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Verifying implementation"},
  {"content": "Run E2E tests", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Running E2E tests"},
  {"content": "Generate user documentation", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Generating user documentation"},
  {"content": "Finalize workflow", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Finalizing workflow"}
]
```

**Skip phases based on task type** (remove from todo list when known):

At initialization (task type known):
- **Not part of initiative**: Skip "Check dependencies"
- **Not bug fix**: Skip "Write failing test (TDD Red)" and "Verify test passes (TDD Green)"
- **Bug fix**: Skip "Run E2E tests" and "Generate user documentation"

After gap analysis (clarification needs known):
- **No clarifications needed** (no decisions_needed, no scope_expansion_recommended, ui_heavy=false): Skip "Clarify scope & approach"
- **Not UI-heavy** (ui_heavy=false): Skip "Generate UI mockups" and "Run E2E tests"
- **Simple task** (not complex, single approach): Skip "Clarify technical approach" and "Decide architecture"

After Phase 10 (user can override):
- **User disabled E2E**: Skip "Run E2E tests"
- **User disabled docs**: Skip "Generate user documentation"

### Step 2: Output Initialization Summary

**Output this summary to the user:**

```
🚀 Development Orchestrator Started

Task: [task description]
Type: [Bug Fix / Enhancement / Feature]
Mode: [Interactive/YOLO]
Directory: [task-path]

Workflow phases:
[Todos list with status]

[Interactive mode] You'll be prompted for review after each phase.
[YOLO mode] All phases will run continuously.

Starting Phase 1: Analyze codebase...
```

### Step 3: Phase Summary Output (After Each Phase)

**CRITICAL: After EVERY phase completes, output a summary BEFORE prompting the user:**

```
✅ Phase [N] Complete: [Phase Name]

Results:
- [Key result 1 - what was accomplished]
- [Key result 2 - what was produced]

Outputs:
- [output-file.md]

Status: Success
```

**DO NOT skip this summary.** Users need visibility into what each phase accomplished.

See `orchestrator-framework/references/phase-execution-pattern.md` STEP 7 for full template.

### Step 4: Only Then Proceed to Phase 1

After completing Steps 1, 2, and understanding Step 3, proceed to Phase 1 (Codebase Analysis).

## When to Use This Skill

Use for **all development tasks**:
- **Bug fixes**: Fix defects, errors, crashes
- **Enhancements**: Improve existing features
- **New features**: Add completely new functionality

**DO NOT use for**:
- Performance optimization (use `performance-orchestrator`)
- Security remediation (use `security-orchestrator`)
- Code migrations (use `migration-orchestrator`)
- Documentation only (use `documentation-orchestrator`)
- Pure refactoring (use `refactoring-orchestrator`)

## Core Principles

1. **Unified Workflow**: Same phases for all task types, different focus
2. **Task-Type Awareness**: Adapt behavior based on bug/enhancement/feature
3. **TDD for Bugs**: Mandatory Red→Green discipline for bug fixes
4. **Gap Analysis for All**: Compare current vs desired state systematically
5. **Clarifying Questions First**: Resolve ambiguities BEFORE detailed analysis

## Phase Flow Quick Reference

| Transition | Type | Reason |
|------------|------|--------|
| Phase 0 → 1 | 🚦 GATE | Standard pause point |
| **Phase 1 → 1.5** | ⚡ AUTO | Phase 1.5 handles interaction |
| Phase 1.5 → 2 | 🚦 GATE | Standard pause point |
| Phase 2 → 3 | 🚦 GATE | Standard pause point |
| **Phase 3 → 3.5** | ⚡ AUTO (conditional) | If ui_heavy; skip to 4.5 otherwise |
| Phase 3.5 → 4 | 🚦 GATE | Standard pause point |
| **Phase 4 → 4.5** | ⚡ AUTO (conditional) | If complex; skip to 5 otherwise |
| Phase 4.5 → 5 | 🚦 GATE | Standard pause point |
| Phase 5 → 5.5 | 🚦 GATE | Standard pause point |
| Phase 5.5 → 6 | 🚦 GATE | Standard pause point |
| Phase 6 → 7 | 🚦 GATE | Standard pause point |
| Phase 7 → 8 | 🚦 GATE | Standard pause point |
| Phase 8 → 9 | 🚦 GATE (conditional) | TDD gate for bugs only |
| Phase 9 → 10 | 🚦 GATE | Standard pause point |
| Phase 10 → 11 | 🚦 GATE | Standard pause point |
| Phase 11 → 12 | 🚦 GATE | Standard pause point |
| Phase 12 → 13 | 🚦 GATE | Standard pause point |
| Phase 13 → 14 | 🚦 GATE | Standard pause point |

**Legend**:
- 🚦 GATE = Check mode, prompt if interactive, auto-continue if YOLO
- ⚡ AUTO = Always continue immediately (no mode check, no user prompt)
- (conditional) = Check conditions before applying pattern

---

## Task Type Detection

**Automatic Detection** from task description:

| Type | Keywords | Directory |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Bug** | fix, bug, broken, error, crash, fails, not working | `.ai-sdlc/tasks/bug-fixes/` |
| **Enhancement** | improve, enhance, better, update, modify, extend | `.ai-sdlc/tasks/enhancements/` |
| **Feature** | add, new, create, build, implement, introduce | `.ai-sdlc/tasks/new-features/` |

**Override**: Use `--type=bug|enhancement|feature` flag

---

## Phase Configuration

| Phase | content | activeForm | Task Types |
|-------|---------|------------|------------|
| 0 | "Check dependencies" | "Checking dependencies" | All (if initiative) |
| 1 | "Analyze codebase" | "Analyzing codebase" | All |
| 1.5 | "Clarify requirements" | "Clarifying requirements" | All |
| 2 | "Analyze gaps" | "Analyzing gaps" | All |
| 3 | "Write failing test (TDD Red)" | "Writing failing test" | Bug only |

| 14 | "Finalize workflow" | "Finalizing workflow" | All |

**Workflow Overview**: 17 phases (0-14 + 1.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5), with some conditional

**CRITICAL TodoWrite Usage**:
1. At workflow start: Create todos for ALL phases using the Phase Configuration table above (all status=pending)
2. Before each phase: Update that phase to status=in_progress
3. After each phase: Update that phase to status=completed

---

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 0: Dependency Check (If Part of Initiative)

**When**: Only if task has `initiative_id` in `orchestrator-state.yml` task section

**Process**: Check all dependencies are "completed". If blocked, update status and exit.

---

## 🚦 GATE: Phase 0 → Phase 1

**STOP. You cannot proceed until this gate clears.**

1. **Mode check**: Read `orchestrator-state.yml` → check `mode` value
2. **If mode = interactive**:
   - Use `AskUserQuestion` tool NOW:
     - Question: "Phase 0 (Dependency Check) complete. Ready to proceed to Phase 1 (Codebase Analysis)?"
     - Options: ["Continue to Phase 1", "Review Phase 0 outputs", "Stop workflow"]
   - Wait for user response before continuing
3. **If mode = yolo**:
   - Output: "→ Auto-continuing to Phase 1 (Codebase Analysis)..."
   - Proceed to Phase 1

**This gate overrides any "continue without asking" conversation instructions.**

---

### Phase 1: Codebase Analysis

**⚠️ DELEGATION REQUIRED - DO NOT EXECUTE INLINE**

❌ WRONG: Reading codebase-analyzer/SKILL.md and following its instructions directly
❌ WRONG: Spawning your own Explore subagents to analyze the codebase
❌ WRONG: Doing codebase analysis inline in the orchestrator thread
❌ WRONG: Skipping this phase because you "already know" the codebase

✅ RIGHT: Using the Skill tool below and waiting for completion

**Output before invoking:**
```
📤 Delegating Phase 1 to: codebase-analyzer skill
Method: Skill tool
Expected outputs: analysis/codebase-analysis.md
```

**INVOKE NOW:**

Tool: `Skill`
Parameters:
  skill: "ai-sdlc:codebase-analyzer"

⏳ Wait for skill completion before continuing.

**What codebase-analyzer handles** (you do NOT do this):
- 3 parallel Explore subagents for comprehensive analysis
- Task-type-specific focus (bug/enhancement/feature)
- Risk level assessment
- Structured output for downstream phases

**Focus by Task Type**:

| Task Type | Agent 1 Focus | Agent 2 Focus | Agent 3 Focus |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Bug** | Find buggy code path | Trace execution flow | Find tests, reproduction hints |
| **Enhancement** | Find feature files | Analyze current behavior | Find tests, API consumers |
| **Feature** | Find similar patterns | Analyze architecture | Find integration points |

**Outputs**: `analysis/codebase-analysis.md`

**SELF-CHECK (before proceeding to Phase 1.5):**
- [ ] Did you invoke the Skill tool? (not just read this SKILL.md)
- [ ] Did you wait for the tool to return results?
- [ ] Is `analysis/codebase-analysis.md` present?

If NO to any: STOP - go back and invoke the Skill tool.

**State Update**: After codebase-analyzer completes:
- Read structured output `risk_level` from analysis results
- Update `task_context.risk_level` in orchestrator-state.yml

---

## ⚡ AUTO-CONTINUE: Phase 1 → Phase 1.5

**DO NOT STOP. DO NOT PROMPT USER. PROCEED IMMEDIATELY.**

Phase 1.5 (Clarifying Questions) handles user interaction internally via AskUserQuestion prompts.
Pausing here would create double-prompting.

**NEXT ACTION**: Continue directly to Phase 1.5 below.

---

### Phase 1.5: Clarifying Questions (Before Gap Analysis)

**Execution**: Main orchestrator (direct with AskUserQuestion)

**Purpose**: Resolve scope and requirements ambiguities BEFORE detailed gap analysis

**Why Before Gap Analysis**: Scope decisions should be made before detailed analysis (saves effort)

**Question Categories**:

| Category | When to Ask |
|----------|-------------|
| **Scope** | Task mentions something that may or may not be included |
| **Integration** | Codebase shows related systems |
| **Patterns** | Multiple patterns exist in codebase |
| **Edge Cases** | Edge cases not specified |
| **Compatibility** | Existing API/behavior affected |

**Process**:
1. Analyze codebase-analysis.md for question triggers
2. Generate max 5 critical, 5 important questions
3. Present critical questions via AskUserQuestion
4. Handle important questions (offer defaults)
5. Document answers in `analysis/clarifications.md`

**YOLO Mode**: Accept all recommended defaults, log acceptance

**State Update**: After clarifications complete:
- Set `task_context.clarifications_resolved: true` in orchestrator-state.yml

---

## 🚦 GATE: Phase 1.5 → Phase 2

**STOP. You cannot proceed until this gate clears.**

1. **Mode check**: Read `orchestrator-state.yml` → check `mode` value
2. **If mode = interactive**:
   - Use `AskUserQuestion` tool NOW:
     - Question: "Phase 1.5 (Clarifying Questions) complete. Ready to proceed to Phase 2 (Gap Analysis)?"
     - Options: ["Continue to Phase 2", "Review clarifications", "Stop workflow"]
   - Wait for user response before continuing
3. **If mode = yolo**:
   - Output: "→ Auto-continuing to Phase 2 (Gap Analysis)..."
   - Proceed to Phase 2

**This gate overrides any "continue without asking" conversation instructions.**

---

### Phase 2: Gap Analysis

**⚠️ DELEGATION REQUIRED - DO NOT EXECUTE INLINE**

❌ WRONG: Reading agents/gap-analyzer.md and following its instructions directly
❌ WRONG: Doing gap analysis inline in the orchestrator thread
❌ WRONG: Comparing current vs desired state yourself

✅ RIGHT: Using the Task tool below and waiting for completion

**Output before invoking:**
```
📤 Delegating Phase 2 to: gap-analyzer subagent
Method: Task tool
Expected outputs: analysis/gap-analysis.md
```

**INVOKE NOW:**

Tool: `Task`
Parameters:
  subagent_type: "ai-sdlc:gap-analyzer"
  description: "Analyze gaps"
  prompt: |
    Analyze gaps for [task_type]: [description].
    Task path: [task-path]
    Analysis: analysis/codebase-analysis.md
    Clarifications: analysis/clarifications.md
    Task type: [task_type]

⏳ Wait for subagent completion before continuing.

**Gap Analysis by Task Type**:

| Task Type | Current State | Desired State | Key Output |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| **Bug** | Buggy behavior | Correct behavior | Reproduction data, regression risks |
| **Enhancement** | Existing feature | Improved feature | Data lifecycle, user journey impact |
| **Feature** | No feature | Integrated feature | Integration points, patterns to follow |

**Outputs**: `analysis/gap-analysis.md`

**SELF-CHECK (before proceeding to Phase 3):**
- [ ] Did you invoke the Task tool? (not just read the agent file)
- [ ] Did you wait for the tool to return results?
- [ ] Is `analysis/gap-analysis.md` present?

If NO to any: STOP - go back and invoke the Task tool.

**State Update**: After gap-analyzer completes, read structured output:
- Update `task_context.ui_heavy` from output `ui_heavy` field
- Update `task_context.risk_level` from output `risk_level` (if currently null)
- For bugs: Update `task_context.reproduction_data` from output `reproduction_data`
- **Calculate `task_context.needs_clarification`** (DO NOT blindly trust gap-analyzer's flag - verify from components):
  ```
  needs_clarification = (
    decisions_needed.critical.length > 0 OR
    decisions_needed.important.length > 0 OR
    scope_expansion_recommended == true OR
    ui_heavy == true
  )
  ```
  **Even if gap-analyzer says `needs_clarification: false`, recalculate from above.**
- Set `options.e2e_enabled`: true if feature/enhancement AND ui_heavy, false for bugs
- Set `options.user_docs_enabled`: true if feature/enhancement, false for bugs

---

## 🚦 GATE: Phase 2 → Phase 3

**STOP. You cannot proceed until this gate clears.**

1. **Mode check**: Read `orchestrator-state.yml` → check `mode` value
2. **If mode = interactive**:
   - Use `AskUserQuestion` tool NOW:
     - Question: "Phase 2 (Gap Analysis) complete. Ready to proceed to Phase 3 (TDD Red Gate)?"
     - Options: ["Continue to Phase 3", "Review gap analysis", "Stop workflow"]
   - Wait for user response before continuing
3. **If mode = yolo**:
   - Output: "→ Auto-continuing to Phase 3 (TDD Red Gate)..."
   - Proceed to Phase 3

**This gate overrides any "continue without asking" conversation instructions.**

---

### Phase 3: TDD Red Gate (Bug Only)

**When**: task_type = "bug" AND TDD applicable

**Purpose**: Write a failing test that reproduces the bug

**Process**:
1. Using reproduction data from Phase 2, write test with exact inputs/state
2. Assert expected correct behavior
3. Run test - **Verify test FAILS** (proves bug exists)
4. If test passes: Bug doesn't exist or test doesn't reproduce it

**Critical Gate**: Cannot proceed if test passes before implementation

**TDD Exception Path**: Document in `implementation/tdd-exception.md` with alternative validation

**Outputs**: `implementation/tdd-red-gate.md`, failing test file

---

## ⚡ AUTO-CONTINUE: Phase 3 → Phase 3.5/4.5 (Conditional)

**DO NOT STOP. DO NOT PROMPT USER. PROCEED IMMEDIATELY.**

**Evaluate condition:**
1. Read `task_context.needs_clarification` from `orchestrator-state.yml`
2. **If needs_clarification = true**: Continue to Phase 3.5 (Clarify Scope & Approach)
3. **If needs_clarification = false**: Skip to Phase 4.5 (Clarify Technical Approach) or Phase 5 if not complex

**`needs_clarification` is true if ANY of these from gap analysis:**
- `decisions_needed.critical` is non-empty
- `decisions_needed.important` is non-empty
- `scope_expansion_recommended = true`
- `ui_heavy = true`

Phase 3.5 handles user interaction internally via AskUserQuestion.
No pause needed before clarifying phases.

**NEXT ACTION**: Continue based on condition above.

---

### Phase 3.5: Clarify Scope & Approach (Conditional)

**Execution**: Main orchestrator (direct with AskUserQuestion)

**When**: `needs_clarification = true` (set by gap analysis)

**`needs_clarification` is true if ANY of:**
- `decisions_needed.critical` is non-empty
- `decisions_needed.important` is non-empty
- `scope_expansion_recommended = true`
- `ui_heavy = true`

**Skip if**: All above conditions are false (no decisions needed, no scope expansion, not UI-heavy)

**Purpose**: Resolve scope and approach decisions BEFORE generating mockups or creating specification

**Question Categories** (in order of priority):

| Category | When to Ask | Example Questions |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Scope Expansion** | `scope_expansion_recommended = true` | "Gap analysis found orphaned display (no input). Expand scope to add input form?" |
| **Critical Decisions** | `decisions_needed.critical` non-empty | Present critical blocking issues with options from gap analysis |
| **Important Decisions** | `decisions_needed.important` non-empty | Present important issues with defaults from gap analysis |
| **Component Choice** | `ui_heavy = true` | "Use existing DatePicker or build custom?" |
| **Layout** | `ui_heavy = true` | "Modal dialog or inline expansion?" |
| **Styling** | `ui_heavy = true` | "Match existing theme or new design?" |
| **Interaction** | `ui_heavy = true` | "Immediate save or explicit submit?" |

**Process**:
1. Read gap-analysis.md structured output
2. If `scope_expansion_recommended = true`: Present scope expansion question first
3. If `decisions_needed.critical` non-empty: Present critical decisions (these are blocking)
4. If `decisions_needed.important` non-empty: Present important decisions with defaults
5. If `ui_heavy = true`: Present UI-specific questions (max 3-5)
6. Document all answers in `analysis/scope-clarifications.md`

**YOLO Mode**: Accept all recommended defaults/recommendations, log acceptance

**State Update**: After clarifications complete:
- Set `task_context.clarifications_complete: true` in orchestrator-state.yml
- Set `task_context.scope_expanded: true/false` based on user's scope expansion decision

**Outputs**: `analysis/scope-clarifications.md`

---

## 🚦 GATE: Phase 3.5 → Phase 4

**STOP. You cannot proceed until this gate clears.**

1. **Mode check**: Read `orchestrator-state.yml` → check `mode` value
2. **If mode = interactive**:
   - Use `AskUserQuestion` tool NOW:
     - Question: "Phase 3.5 (Clarify Scope & Approach) complete. Ready to proceed to Phase 4 (UI Mockup Generation)?"
     - Options: ["Continue to Phase 4", "Review scope clarifications", "Stop workflow"]
   - Wait for user response before continuing
3. **If mode = yolo**:
   - Output: "→ Auto-continuing to Phase 4 (UI Mockup Generation)..."
   - Proceed to Phase 4

**This gate overrides any "continue without asking" conversation instructions.**

---

### Phase 4: UI Mockup Generation (Conditional)

**When**: Enhancement or feature with `ui_heavy = true`

**Skip if**: Bug fix OR `ui_heavy = false`

**⚠️ DELEGATION REQUIRED - DO NOT EXECUTE INLINE**

❌ WRONG: Reading agents/ui-mockup-generator.md and following its instructions directly
❌ WRONG: Generating ASCII mockups inline in the orchestrator thread
❌ WRONG: Skipping this phase when ui_heavy = true

✅ RIGHT: Using the Task tool below and waiting for completion

**Output before invoking:**
```
📤 Delegating Phase 4 to: ui-mockup-generator subagent
Method: Task tool
Expected outputs: analysis/ui-mockups.md
```

**INVOKE NOW:**

Tool: `Task`
Parameters:
  subagent_type: "ai-sdlc:ui-mockup-generator"
  description: "Generate UI mockups"
  prompt: |
    Generate ASCII mockups for: [description]
    Task path: [task-path]
    Gap analysis: analysis/gap-analysis.md
    Scope clarifications: analysis/scope-clarifications.md

⏳ Wait for subagent completion before continuing.

**Outputs**: `analysis/ui-mockups.md`

**SELF-CHECK (before proceeding to Phase 4.5):**
- [ ] Did you invoke the Task tool? (not just read the agent file)
- [ ] Did you wait for the tool to return results?
- [ ] Is `analysis/ui-mockups.md` present?

If NO to any: STOP - go back and invoke the Task tool.

---

## ⚡ AUTO-CONTINUE: Phase 4 → Phase 4.5/5 (Conditional)

**DO NOT STOP. DO NOT PROMPT USER. PROCEED IMMEDIATELY.**

**Evaluate condition:**
1. Read `task_context.risk_level` from `orchestrator-state.yml`
2. **If risk_level = medium/high OR complex task detected**: Continue to Phase 4.5
3. **If risk_level = low AND simple task**: Skip to Phase 5 (Specification)

Phase 4.5 handles user interaction internally via AskUserQuestion.
No pause needed before clarifying phases.

**NEXT ACTION**: Continue based on condition above.

---

### Phase 4.5: Clarify Technical Approach (Conditional)

**Execution**: Main orchestrator (direct with AskUserQuestion)

**When**: Complex task OR multiple valid approaches detected in gap analysis

**Skip if**: Simple/straightforward task, or technical approach already clear from requirements

**Trigger Detection**:
- Gap analysis mentions multiple approaches
- Risk level = medium or high
- New technology/library decision needed
- Core architecture affected (data model, API, state management)

**Purpose**: Resolve technical decisions BEFORE creating specification

**Question Categories**:

| Category | Example Questions |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Data Model** | "New entity or extend existing?" |
| **API Design** | "REST endpoint or extend existing?" |
| **State Management** | "Local state or global store?" |
| **Compatibility** | "Break backward compat or maintain?" |

**Process**:
1. Analyze gap-analysis.md for technical decision points
2. Generate max 3-5 technical questions
3. Present via AskUserQuestion
4. Document answers in `analysis/technical-clarifications.md`

**YOLO Mode**: Accept all recommended defaults, log acceptance

**State Update**: After technical clarifications complete:
- Set `task_context.tech_clarified: true` in orchestrator-state.yml

**Outputs**: `analysis/technical-clarifications.md`

---

## 🚦 GATE: Phase 4.5 → Phase 5

**STOP. You cannot proceed until this gate clears.**

1. **Mode check**: Read `orchestrator-state.yml` → check `mode` value
2. **If mode = interactive**:
   - Use `AskUserQuestion` tool NOW:
     - Question: "Phase 4.5 (Clarify Technical Approach) complete. Ready to proceed to Phase 5 (Specification)?"
     - Options: ["Continue to Phase 5", "Review technical clarifications", "Stop workflow"]
   - Wait for user response before continuing
3. **If mode = yolo**:
   - Output: "→ Auto-continuing to Phase 5 (Specification)..."
   - Proceed to Phase 5

**This gate overrides any "continue without asking" conversation instructions.**

---

### Phase 5: Specification

**⚠️ DELEGATION REQUIRED - DO NOT EXECUTE INLINE**

❌ WRONG: Reading specification-creator/SKILL.md and following its instructions directly
❌ WRONG: Writing spec.md or requirements.md inline in the orchestrator thread
❌ WRONG: Gathering requirements yourself instead of letting the skill do it

✅ RIGHT: Using the Skill tool below and waiting for completion

**Output before invoking:**
```
📤 Delegating Phase 5 to: specification-creator skill
Method: Skill tool
Expected outputs: implementation/spec.md, implementation/requirements.md
```

**INVOKE NOW:**

Tool: `Skill`
Parameters:
  skill: "ai-sdlc:specification-creator"

⏳ Wait for skill completion before continuing.

**What specification-creator handles** (you do NOT do this):
- 4-phase spec creation (init → research → write → verify)
- Standards awareness from docs/INDEX.md
- Task-type-specific sections (bug/enhancement/feature)
- Requirements gathering and documentation

**Task-Type-Specific Sections**:
- **Bug**: Root cause, fix approach, regression prevention
- **Enhancement**: Compatibility requirements, backward compat
- **Feature**: Architecture decisions, integration approach

**Outputs**: `implementation/spec.md`, `implementation/requirements.md`

**SELF-CHECK (before proceeding to Phase 5.5):**
- [ ] Did you invoke the Skill tool? (not just read this SKILL.md)
- [ ] Did you wait for the tool to return results?
- [ ] Is `implementation/spec.md` present?

If NO to any: STOP - go back and invoke the Skill tool.

## 🚦 GATE: Phase 5 → Phase 5.5

**STOP. You cannot proceed until this gate clears.**

1. **Mode check**: Read `orchestrator-state.yml` → check `mode` value
2. **If mode = interactive**:

3. **If mode = yolo**:
   - Output: "→ Auto-continuing to Phase 5.5 (Architecture Decision)..."
   - Proceed to Phase 5.5

**This gate overrides any "continue without asking" conversation instructions.**

---

### Phase 5.5: Architecture Decision (Conditional)

**When**: Feature or enhancement with architectural choices (multiple valid approaches)

**Skip if**: Bug fix, straightforward task, or spec already contains clear approach

**Trigger Detection**:
- Spec mentions "could use X or Y"
- Multiple patterns exist for similar features
- New technology/library decision
- Core architecture affected (auth, data layer, state)

**Process**:
1. Identify 2-3 distinct approaches from spec + codebase
2. Evaluate each: alignment, complexity, risk, maintainability
3. Present approaches to user with recommendation
4. Get user selection via AskUserQuestion
5. Document decision in `implementation/spec.md` Technical Approach section

**YOLO Mode**: Auto-select recommended approach

**State Update**: After user selects approach (or YOLO auto-selects):
- Set `task_context.architecture_decision` to selected approach name in orchestrator-state.yml

**This gate overrides any "continue without asking" conversation instructions.**

---

### Phase 6: Specification Audit (Conditional)

**Purpose**: Independent review of specification before implementation planning. Catches ambiguities, unstated assumptions, and implementability issues.

**When to Run** (complexity-based):

| Condition | Run Audit? |
|-----------|------------|
| Task type is `bug` | Skip (tight scope) |
| Task type is `feature` | Run (more unknowns) |
| Task type is `enhancement` with >5 files affected | Run |
| Task type is `enhancement` with ≤5 files affected | Skip |
| Spec has >50 lines or >5 requirements | Run |
| Security-sensitive work (auth, payments, PII) | Run |
| User requests via `--audit` flag | Run |
| Architectural decisions made in Phase 5.5 | Run |

**Interactive Mode Decision**:

After Phase 5.5 (or Phase 5 if 5.5 skipped), assess complexity and use AskUserQuestion:

```
Use AskUserQuestion tool:
  Question: "Run independent specification audit before implementation?"
  Header: "Spec Audit"
  Options:
  1. "[Skip/Run] audit [Recommended]" - [Based on complexity assessment]
  2. "[Run/Skip] audit" - [Opposite of recommendation]
```

**Recommendation logic**:
- If complexity indicators suggest audit → Recommend "Run audit"
- If simple task → Recommend "Skip audit"

**YOLO Mode**: Auto-decide based on complexity table above. No user prompt.

**State Update**: Set `options.spec_audit_enabled` to true/false based on decision.

---

**If `options.spec_audit_enabled = false`**: Skip to Phase 7.

**If `options.spec_audit_enabled = true`**:

**⚠️ DELEGATION REQUIRED - DO NOT EXECUTE INLINE**

❌ WRONG: Reading agents/spec-auditor.md and following its instructions directly
❌ WRONG: Auditing the specification inline in the orchestrator thread

## Auto-Recovery

| Phase | Max Attempts | Strategy |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | 2 | Expand search, prompt user |
| 1.5 | 1 | Accept defaults if unclear |
| 2 | 2 | Re-analyze, ask user |
| 3 | 2 | Rewrite test, skip TDD with doc |
| 4 | 1 | Continue without mockups |
| 5 | 2 | Regenerate spec |
| 5.5 | 1 | Auto-select recommendation |
| 6 | 1 | Highlight issues |
| 7 | 2 | Regenerate plan |
| 8 | 5 | Fix syntax, imports, tests |
| 9 | 3 | Return to implementation |
| 11 | 3 | Fix tests, re-run |
| 12 | 2 | Prompt app start, fix UI |
| 13 | 1 | Text-only fallback |

---

## Command Flags

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--type=bug\|enhancement\|feature` | Override task type detection |
| `--yolo` | Continuous execution (TDD gates still enforced) |
| `--from=PHASE` | Start from specific phase |
| `--audit` / `--no-audit` | Force/skip specification audit (Phase 6) |
| `--e2e` / `--no-e2e` | Force/skip E2E testing |
| `--user-docs` / `--no-user-docs` | Force/skip user documentation |
| `--code-review` / `--no-code-review` | Force/skip code review |

---

## Command Integration

Invoked via:
- `/ai-sdlc:development:new [description] [--type=TYPE] [--yolo]`
- `/ai-sdlc:development:resume [task-path] [--from=PHASE]`

**Legacy Aliases** (route to this orchestrator):
- `/ai-sdlc:bug-fix:new` → `--type=bug`
- `/ai-sdlc:enhancement:new` → `--type=enhancement`
- `/ai-sdlc:feature:new` → `--type=feature`

---

## TDD Gate Rules (Bug Fixes)

**Phase 3 (Red Gate)**:
- Test MUST FAIL before implementation
- If passes: Bug doesn't exist or test wrong
- Exception path available with documentation

**Phase 9 (Green Gate)**:
- Test MUST PASS after implementation
- If fails: Implementation didn't fix bug
- Cannot skip - TDD discipline enforced

**YOLO Mode**: TDD gates still enforced (cannot be bypassed)

---

## Success Criteria

Workflow successful when:

- Codebase analyzed and clarifications resolved
- Gap analysis complete for task type
- TDD gates pass (bug only)
- Specification created and audited
- Architecture decision documented (feature/enhancement if applicable)
- Implementation plan complete
- Implementation passes tests
- Verification complete with chosen checks
- Optional phases complete (if enabled)
- Ready for commit and code review
