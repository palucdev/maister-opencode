# Workflow Details

Maister provides six workflow types, each with phases tailored to its needs. All workflows support **interactive mode** (pause between phases for review) and **YOLO mode** (`--yolo` for continuous execution).

## Development Workflow

The unified development workflow handles features, enhancements, and bug fixes through a 14-phase adaptive pipeline. Phases activate or skip based on task type.

```
/maister:development-new
/maister:development-new "Add two-factor authentication"
/maister:development-new "Fix login timeout" --type=bug
```

When run without arguments, the plugin extracts the task description from your conversation and auto-detects the type (feature, bug, or enhancement). Use `--type=` only when you want to override the auto-detection.

**Flags**: `--type=bug|enhancement|feature`, `--yolo`, `--e2e`, `--user-docs`, `--code-review`, `--research=PATH`, `--from=PHASE`

### Phases

| # | Phase | Applies To |
|---|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Codebase analysis + clarifications | All |
| 2 | Gap analysis with decision gates | All |
| 3 | TDD Red gate (write failing test first) | Bug fixes only |
| 4 | UI mockups (ASCII) | Features & enhancements (UI-heavy) |
| 5 | Requirements + specification | All |
| 6 | Specification audit | All (recommended) |
| 7 | Implementation planning | All |
| 8 | Implementation execution | All |
| 9 | TDD Green gate (verify test passes) | Bug fixes only |
| 10 | Verification options selection | All |
| 11 | Verification + issue resolution | All |
| 12 | E2E testing | Optional (`--e2e`) |
| 13 | User documentation | Optional (`--user-docs`) |
| 14 | Finalization | All |

### Research-Based Development

Start development informed by a completed research workflow. Research context flows through all phases:

```
/maister:development-new "Implement OAuth" --research=.maister/tasks/research/2026-01-12-oauth-research
```

Research artifacts are copied to `analysis/research-context/` and summaries pass to every subagent.

### Resume

```
/maister:development-resume [task-path] [--from=PHASE] [--reset-attempts]
```

Resume phases: `analysis`, `gap`, `spec`, `plan`, `implement`, `verify`

---

## Performance Optimization

Static code analysis to detect bottlenecks, followed by standard spec/plan/implement/verify pipeline.

```
/maister:performance-new
/maister:performance-new "Optimize dashboard loading time" --yolo
```

### Phases

| # | Phase |
|---|-------|
| 1 | Codebase analysis + clarifications |
| 2 | Static performance analysis (N+1 queries, missing indexes, O(n^2) algorithms, blocking I/O, memory leaks) |
| 3 | Requirements + specification |
| 4 | Specification audit (conditional) |
| 5 | Implementation planning |
| 6 | Implementation execution |
| 7 | Verification options |
| 8 | Verification + issue resolution |
| 9 | Finalization |

**Optional profiling data**: You can provide runtime profiling data, flame graphs, or APM screenshots. The workflow creates `analysis/user-profiling-data/` for these files.

### Resume

```
/maister:performance-resume [task-path] [--from=PHASE] [--reset-attempts]
```

Resume phases: `analysis`, `specification`, `planning`, `implementation`, `verification`

---

## Migration

Technology, data, and architecture migrations with rollback planning and risk assessment.

```
/maister:migration-new
/maister:migration-new "Migrate from REST to GraphQL" --type=code
```

**Migration types**: `code`, `data`, `architecture`, `general`

### Phases

| # | Phase |
|---|-------|
| 1 | Current state analysis |
| 2 | Target state planning + gap identification |
| 3 | Migration requirements + strategy specification (includes rollback plan) |
| 4 | Implementation planning |
| 5 | Migration execution |
| 6 | Verification + compatibility testing |
| 7 | Issue resolution (conditional, halts on data integrity issues) |
| 8 | Documentation (optional) |

**Key behaviors**:
- Rollback planning is mandatory
- Dual-run support for zero-downtime migrations
- Halts on data integrity issues (no automatic recovery)
- External research for version upgrades via web search

### Resume

```
/maister:migration-resume [task-path] [--from=PHASE] [--reset-attempts]
```

Resume phases: `analysis`, `target`, `spec`, `plan`, `execute`, `verify`, `docs`

---

## Research

Multi-source research with synthesis, optional solution brainstorming, and high-level design.

```
/maister:research-new
/maister:research-new "What authentication approach fits our architecture?" --type=technical
```

**Research types**: `technical`, `requirements`, `literature`, `mixed`

**Flags**: `--brainstorm` (force brainstorming phases), `--no-brainstorm` (skip them)

### Phases

| # | Phase |
|---|-------|
| 1 | Research foundation: initialize → plan methodology → gather information (parallel) → synthesize findings |
| 2 | Brainstorming decision (evaluate value) |
| 3 | Solution brainstorming (HMW questions + user preferences) |
| 4 | High-level design (C4 diagrams + ADR documentation) |
| 5 | Review outputs |
| 6 | Verification (optional) |
| 7 | Integration (optional) |
| 8 | Spawn development workflow (optional) |

Information gathering runs parallel subagents across multiple source categories (codebase, docs, config, external).

### Resume

```
/maister:research-resume [task-path] [--from=PHASE] [--reset-attempts]
```

Resume phases: `foundation`, `brainstorming-decision`, `brainstorming`, `design`, `outputs`, `verification`, `integration`

---

## Task Directory Structure

All workflows create structured directories in `.maister/tasks/`:

```
.maister/tasks/
├── new-features/          # Feature development
├── bug-fixes/             # Bug fixes
├── enhancements/          # Enhancements
├── performance/           # Performance optimization
├── migrations/            # Migrations
└── research/              # Research
```

Each task folder follows the pattern `YYYY-MM-DD-task-name/`:

```
2026-02-17-user-auth/
├── orchestrator-state.yml        # Workflow state (pause/resume, phase tracking)
├── analysis/
│   ├── requirements.md           # Gathered requirements
│   ├── research-context/         # Research artifacts (if --research used)
│   └── visuals/                  # UI mockups (if UI-heavy)
├── implementation/
│   ├── spec.md                   # Specification (WHAT to build)
│   ├── implementation-plan.md    # Step breakdown (HOW to build it)
│   └── work-log.md              # Chronological activity log
├── verification/                  # Verification reports
└── documentation/                 # User-facing docs (optional)
```

## Internal Skills

These skills are invoked automatically by the orchestrators — you don't call them directly:

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **codebase-analyzer** | Launches parallel Explore subagents to analyze your codebase, synthesizes findings into a report |
| **implementer** | Executes implementation plans with mandatory standards reading and test-driven enforcement |
| **implementation-plan-executor** | Adaptive execution (direct for ≤5 steps, delegated for 6+) with continuous standards discovery |
| **implementation-verifier** | Delegates verification to specialized subagents: test runner, code reviewer, pragmatic reviewer, reality assessor, production readiness checker |
| **task-classifier** | Classifies task descriptions into types (bug, feature, enhancement, performance, migration, research) with confidence scoring |
| **docs-manager** | Internal engine for managing `.maister/docs/` structure, INDEX.md, and standards files |
