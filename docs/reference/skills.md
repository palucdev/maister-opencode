# Skills Reference

Complete reference of all skills (workflows and utilities) in the AI SDLC plugin.

## Overview

Skills are autonomous workflows that orchestrate complex tasks. There are two types:
- **Orchestrator Skills**: Multi-phase workflows for complete task execution
- **Utility Skills**: Specialized capabilities invoked by orchestrators

## Orchestrator Framework (Shared Patterns)

All orchestrator skills share common patterns documented in `skills/orchestrator-framework/references/`:

| Pattern | File | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| Phase Execution | `phase-execution-pattern.md` | 7-step loop for each phase |
| State Management | `state-management.md` | orchestrator-state.yml schema |
| Interactive Mode | `interactive-mode.md` | Post-phase prompts, user decisions |
| Initialization | `initialization-pattern.md` | Startup sequence, directory setup |

This is a **non-executable reference skill** - it provides documentation, not workflow execution. All orchestrators reference these patterns via relative paths (`../orchestrator-framework/references/`).

**Use When**: Building new features, improving existing features, or fixing bugs

**Commands**:
- `/ai-sdlc:development:new` - Start unified workflow (recommended)
- `/ai-sdlc:development:resume` - Resume interrupted workflow

**Legacy Commands** (still work as aliases):

## Skill Invocation

Skills are invoked automatically by:
1. **Commands** - Slash commands invoke orchestrator skills
2. **Orchestrators** - Orchestrator skills invoke utility skills
3. **Agents** - Some skills delegate to specialized agents

Users typically interact with orchestrator skills via commands, not directly.
